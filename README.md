# SFML_snake
A simple game following the rules of a traditional [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre) "Snake on Wikipedia") game. 

## Technologies
This project uses: C++20, SFML 2.5.1, and Cmake.

## Installation
At this time building for linux is as easy as installing SFML for linux by following their [website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/) and then running cmake. You may need to modify the CMakeLists.txt to better suit your SFML installation.

For windows the process is similar but I havent personally tested it.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is for my own personal growth in C++ and programming concepts in general.
I am working to make the code behind this project easy to read and scalable. I have plenty to learn but this project is shaping up to be a wonderful starting point.
